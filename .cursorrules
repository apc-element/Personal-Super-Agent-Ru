# Personal Workspace - AI Assistant Rules

> **📝 File Purpose**: This file contains AI assistant rules for personal workspace management and organization.

## Workspace Overview
You are working in a personal workspace designed for organizing projects, notes, research, and ideas using AI assistance.

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Number Range Validation

**ALWAYS use the range checking script for numerical comparisons - NEVER do mental math for ranges:**

When you need to check if any number falls within a range:
1. **STOP** - Do not attempt to compare numbers mentally
2. **USE THE SCRIPT**: `python3 scripts/check_range.py [value] [min] [max] [value] [min] [max] ...`
3. **EXAMPLE**: `python3 scripts/check_range.py 185 125 200 92 70 100`
4. **TRUST THE RESULT**: Use the script output, not your own calculation

**Why this rule exists**: LLMs frequently make errors with numerical comparisons. The script provides 100% accurate mathematical results.

**Common use cases**:
- Health metrics (cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure)
- Budget categories (spending within planned ranges)
- Financial targets (investment performance ranges)
- Any situation requiring "is X between Y and Z?"

## General Guidelines
- Help organize and manage personal projects and documentation
- Maintain consistent structure and naming conventions  
- Assist with content creation, research, and analysis
- Provide helpful suggestions for workspace organization
- Use web search when research is needed
- Connect information across different areas (health, finance, learning, etc.)

## File Management
- Use clear, descriptive file and folder names
- Maintain logical organization structure
- Keep related materials grouped together
- Regular cleanup and organization of outdated content
- Always reference actual file paths when suggesting connections

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Be helpful and proactive in suggesting improvements
- Ask clarifying questions when tasks are unclear
- Provide context and explanations for recommendations
- Respect user preferences and working style
- **NEVER** perform numerical range comparisons without the script
- Document sources when conducting research
- Create cross-references between related content

## Integration Rules
- Link related information across Health, Finance, Learning, and Home categories
- Use examples from actual files when providing guidance
- Suggest automation opportunities with scripts
- Maintain consistency in documentation format
- Always verify numerical data with appropriate tools

## Information Architecture & Anti-Hallucination Rules

### Core Principle
Eliminate ambiguities, unnecessary duplicates, inconsistencies, and unclear sources while maintaining high accuracy.

### 1. Canonical Definitions & Source Tracking [CANONICAL]
**Core Rule**: Every statement must have a clear, traceable source.

**Canonical Source System**:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept/definition has ONE canonical version in the most logical source document
- **Mark Canonical**: Tag with `[CANONICAL]` in the source document where information is first established
- **Reference Everywhere Else**: All other mentions must use `[REF: folder/filename.md#section]` pointing to canonical source
- **Exact Reuse**: Use identical phrasing across documents when referencing canonical statements
- **Explicit Adaptation**: If context requires changes, mark: `[ADAPTED from filename.md: "original" → "adapted"]`

**Source Tracking Requirements**:
- **No Orphan Statements**: Every claim, metric, or assertion must be traceable to its origin
- **Clear Attribution**: Mark where information came from: personal records, external research, calculations, etc.
- **Update Propagation**: When changing canonical version, search and update all `[REF:]` references
- **Searchable References**: Use consistent `[REF:]` format to enable finding all dependencies

### 2. Data Accuracy & Source Tracking
- **[CANONICAL]**: The authoritative definition/data point in the knowledge base
- **[CONFIRMED: source]**: Information directly verified or provided by reliable sources
- **[PLACEHOLDER: owner]**: Information to be filled with clear ownership
- **[REF: folder/filename.md#section]**: Cross-references for searchability

### 3. Anti-Hallucination Rules
- **Eliminate Hallucinated Content**: Remove any information not confirmed by reliable sources
- **Use Real Data**: Specific metrics and examples from actual records
- **Source Every Statement**: Every claim must be either `[CANONICAL]` (first mention) or `[REF:]` (pointing to canonical source)
- **Mark Placeholders**: Clear ownership for missing information with `[PLACEHOLDER: owner]`
- **Date Everything**: Include "Last Updated" timestamps
- **Maintain Traceability**: When updating canonical information, find and update all references using search
